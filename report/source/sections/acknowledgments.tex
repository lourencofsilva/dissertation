I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Sandra Sampaio, for her invaluable guidance, insightful feedback, and continuous support throughout this research. Her expertise and encouragement have been instrumental in shaping this project.

I also acknowledge Manchester-i for providing the traffic data that made this study possible, a data solution that collects, hosts, and exposes city open-data to a broad set of researchers and end-users operating/interested in urban-related disciplines.

A heartfelt thank you to my friends during this final year for their support, motivation, and well-timed distractions, which helped me stay balanced throughout this journey. Lastly, I am deeply grateful to my family, especially my parents and grandparents, for their continued encouragement, support, and belief in me.
