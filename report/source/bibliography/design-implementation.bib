	abstract = {Unhealthy traffic conditions have significant adverse implications for environment-friendly, sustainable, and energy-efficient development. As an real-time environmental factor contributing to travel, comparing the effect mechanisms of weather on traffic conditions in multiple cities will provide a deeper understanding of the weather-traffic relationship. This study conducts a contrastive analysis of travel time index (TTI) variations under weather conditions in four cities. Notably, this study will consider the potential benefits of replacing an absolute index of traffic conditions, like traffic volume and travel speed, with TTI, a relative index. The results identified a strong association between complex weather measurements and traffic conditions. Overall, the impact of meteorological variables on TTI on non-weekdays might result in significantly worse traffic conditions. On weekdays, the impact is relatively weak, due to the flexibility for travel mode decision-making, especially during the commute hour. Weather impacts on traffic conditions are not only interrelated, like higher temperature with less rainfall or slower wind speeds, but they also varied with urban spatial layout and geographical condition. Besides, the traffic congestion is certainly related to extreme weather, but not closely. This study could benefit transit agencies by adding meteorological monitoring into traffic condition real-time analysis.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML), a computational self-learning platform, is expected to be applied in a variety of settings. ML, on the other hand, uses a model built with a learning structure rather than traditional code that is written line by line in a continuous pattern. These models are created and equipped to determine the results of training using historical data. Scalability is a major challenge in real machine learning programs. Many ML-based technologies are essential to quickly analyze new data and create forecasts, as forecasts become meaningless after a few ticks (think real-time methods such as stock markets and clickstream data). Many machine-learning programs, on the other hand, need to be able to scale and train with gigabytes or terabytes of data during model training (As is found in the model from a web-scale image corpus). High-dimensional challenges pose new obstacles to machine learning professionals who are increasingly interested in scalability as well as algorithm quality. Against the backdrop of the current situation, this overview article on the scope of scalability in machine learning platforms collects, investigates, and analyzes the current state, aspects, and perspectives of scalability that can be added to machine learning platforms in a variety of ways to improve efficiency. The purpose is to do. Reliability when processing large amounts of data.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.113},
	abstract = {CO2 emissions caused by private motorized traffic for the city of Graz, a typical European inland city with about 320 000 citizens, are investigated. The main methodology is a newly developed agent-based model that incorporates empirical data about the mobility behavior of the citizens in order to calculate the traveled routes, the resulting traffic and subsequent emissions. To assess the impact of different policies on CO2 emissions, different scenarios are simulated and their results are compared to a base line scenario. The model features a local and temporal resolution, effects like congestion and stop-and-go traffic as well as commuters to and from other regions. In addition to the evaluation of certain policies (like a focus on electric cars, telecommuting or an improvement of the road infrastructure), a method is provided, that makes it possible to compare many diverse scenarios, featuring technological changes, societal changes or changes in the road network, all within the same framework. The findings suggest that one of the most promising strategies to decrease urban CO2 emissions is to focus on the use of electric cars, especially if it is combined with offering alternatives to private car traffic and incentives for telecommuting. Banning the use of old cars only yields a significant result if a large amount of cars is affected, which would make such a policy difficult to implement. Expanding the road network has no significant positive effect and may even encourage using cars, therefore leading to even more CO2 emissions. Due to its flexible structure the presented model can be used to evaluate policies beyond what is presented in this study. It can easily be adapted to other conditions and geographical regions.},

	abstract = {The control algorithm used for deciding on the speed limit in variable speed limit systems is crucial for the performance of the systems. The algorithm is designed to fulfil the purpose of the variable speed limit system, which can be one or several of the following aspects: increasing safety, increasing efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts. Today, many of the control algorithms used in practice are based on fixed thresholds in speed and/or flow. Therefore, they are not necessarily reflecting the current traffic conditions. Control algorithms with a greater level of complexity can be found in the literature. In this paper, four existing control algorithms are investigated to conclude on important characteristics affecting the performance of the variable speed limit system. The purpose of the variable speed limit system and, consequently, the design of the control algorithm differ. Requirements of the investigated control algorithms are that they should be easy to interpret and the execution time should be short. The algorithms are evaluated through microscopic traffic simulation. Performance indicators related to traffic safety, traffic efficiency and environmental impacts are presented. The results show that the characteristics of the variable speed limit system and the design of the control algorithm will have effect on the resulting traffic performance, given that the drivers comply with the variable speed limits. Moreover, the time needed to trigger the system, the duration and the size of speed limit reductions, and the location of the congestion are factors of importance for the performance of variable speed limit systems.},
