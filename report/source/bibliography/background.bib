	abstract = {Traffic operation efficiency is greatly impacted by the increase in travel demand and the increase in vehicle ownership. The continued increase in traffic demand has rendered the importance of controlling traffic, especially at intersections. In general, the inefficiency of traffic scheduling leads to traffic congestion, resulting in a rise in fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and poor quality of service. Various methods for time series forecasting have been proposed for adaptive and remote traffic control. The prediction of traffic has attracted profound attention for improving the reliability and efficiency of traffic flow scheduling while reducing congestion. Therefore, in this work, we studied the problem of the current traffic situation at Muhima Junction one of the busiest junctions in Kigali city. Future traffic rates were forecasted by employing long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, respectively. Both the models’ performance criteria for adequacy were the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results revealed that LSTM is the best-fitting model for monthly traffic flow prediction. Within this analysis, we proposed an adaptive traffic flow prediction that builds on the features of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and the Internet of Things (IoT) to control traffic while enhancing the quality of service at the junctions. The real-time actuation of traffic-responsive signal control can be assured when real-time traffic-based signal actuation is reliable.},

	abstract = {Smart traffic congestion reduction is actually a real challenge for big cities. Machine learning algorithms can play a significant role in traffic analysis, congestion prediction, and rerouting. In this paper, we propose a new prediction approach to reduce the traffic congestion problem by studying a scheme for predicting traffic flow information using four machine learning techniques: Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), simple linear regression model, and polynomial linear regression model. This prediction scheme is based on the following parameters: the average waiting time at entry and exit street pairs, the days of the week, hours of movement, holidays, and the rain rate. The results indicate that the FFNN technique overcomes the other techniques producing 97.6\% prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Traffic congestion poses a significant challenge in urban environments, leading to delays, increased fuel consumption, and heightened environmental pollution. Addressing this issue, our study presents an innovative dynamic traffic signal control system designed to adapt to real-time traffic conditions. Traditional traffic management systems typically rely on fixed schedules, which are inefficient when dealing with fluctuating traffic volumes. In contrast, our proposed system leverages advanced technologies to optimize traffic flow dynamically. At the core of the system are convolutional neural networks, which process video footage from CCTV cameras to accurately detect and count vehicles. This real-time data enables the system to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, prioritizing lanes with heavier congestion and minimizing overall delays. By effectively responding to changing traffic patterns, the system reduces wait times and alleviates congestion, as validated through extensive simulations and experimental studies. The proposed approach is both cost-effective and scalable, making it particularly suitable for densely populated regions, such as urban centers in India. Additionally, the system capitalizes on existing infrastructure, providing a practical and efficient solution to urban traffic challenges. Future developments aim to integrate features like emergency vehicle detection and weather condition monitoring, further enhancing the system's responsiveness and optimizing urban traffic management.},

Predictions are done by means of two Machine Learning-based techniques. These have been proven to successfully outperform current state of the art predictions by 35\% in an empirical assessment we conducted over a time frame of 7 months within the inner city of Cologne, Germany. The predicted congestions are fed into a specifically conceived visualization tool we designed to allow Decision Makers to evaluate the situation and take actions to improve mobility.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method that learns traffic as images and predicts large-scale, network-wide traffic speed with a high accuracy. Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are converted to images describing the time and space relations of traffic flow via a two-dimensional time-space matrix. A CNN is applied to the image following two consecutive steps: abstract traffic feature extraction and network-wide traffic speed prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by taking two real-world transportation networks, the second ring road and north-east transportation network in Beijing, as examples, and comparing the method with four prevailing algorithms, namely, ordinary least squares, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, and random forest, and three deep learning architectures, namely, stacked autoencoder, recurrent neural network, and long-short-term memory network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms by an average accuracy improvement of 42.91\% within an acceptable execution time. The CNN can train the model in a reasonable time and, thus, is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.},

	doi = {10.7307/ptt.v34i4.3998},
	abstract = {Traffic flow forecast is critical in today’s transportation system since it is necessary to construct a traffic plan in order to determine a travel route. The goal of this research is to use time-series forecasting models to estimate future traffic in order to reduce traffic congestion on roadways. Minimising prediction error is the most difficult task in traffic prediction. In order to anticipate future traffic flow, the system also requires real-time data from vehicles and roadways. A hybrid autoregressive integrated moving av-erage with multilayer perceptron (ARIMA-MLP) model and a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average with recurrent neural network (ARIMA-RNN) model are proposed in this paper to address these difficulties. The transportation data are used from the UK Highways data-set. The time-series data are preprocessed using a random walk model. The forecasting models autoregressive inte-grated moving average (ARIMA), recurrent neural net-work (RNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are trained and tested. In the proposed hybrid ARIMA-MLP and ARI-MA-RNN models, the residuals from the ARIMA model are used to train the MLP and RNN models. Then the ef-ficacy of the hybrid system is assessed using the metrics MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2 (peak hour forecast-0.936763, non-peak hour forecast-0.87638 on ARIMA-MLP model and peak hour forecast-0.9416466, non-peak hour fore-cast-0.931917 on ARIMA-RNN model).},

	abstract = {SUMO is a microscopic road traffic simulation made available as open source under the GPL license. The complete suite includes tools for importing road networks, generating routes from different sources, and two versions of the traffic simulation itself, one started from the command line and one including a graphical user interface. The simulation uses the microscopic, space-continuous and time-discrete car-following model developed by S. Krauß and a lane-changing model developed within the work on the simulation. Traffic assignment is normally performed using the iterative approach formulated by C. Gawron, but further methods, such as a one-shot assignment method, exists. The traffic simulation offers a socket-based interface to external applications, allowing to interact with a running simulation online. Values and states of objects the simulation consists of can be both retrieved and changed. SUMO has been used within different projects both by the DLR and by external organizations. The software and documentation can be accessed at http://sumo.sf.net.},
